#iber Optic Temperature Measurement
###Operation Instructions
#####For OS X 10.7+

This tutorial will walk you through the steps required to use the LumaSense Technolofies Luxtron FTO Lab Kit, CoolTerm application, and a Mac computer to collect accurate and precise temperature data for various applications.

The tutorial will deal with the software and hardware prerequisites, equipment unpacking and setup, operation of the CoolTerm software, and the logging of data to a text file that can be subsequently accessed through a number of software platforms.
---
##Prerequisites
>In order to read the Luxtron temperature data, you will have to install CoolTerm.
* To install CoolTerm, go to [http://freeware.the-meiers.org/] (http://freeware.the-meiers.org/) and locate the CoolTerm application.
* Click on the link for **Mac** under the CoolTerm logo and download the zip file
* Extract the files from the dowloaded zip file
* Once extracted, the CoolTerm application can be run from the directory it was downloaded to
* *Since Macs typically keep all applications in the Apllications folder, you may move either the entire extracted CoolTerm folder, or just the CoolTerm application to that folder on your computer. The application will run the same way.*

>The Luxtron FOT probes are very thin and very fragile. While they can be used in a variety of media, including water and aqueous solutions, great care must be taken to **ensure the cables are not bent excessively or placed in a substance that could be corosive or become adhered to the end of the optic probe.**

### *Information Specific to Temperature Mesurement with Spinal DWI Phantom*
>For consistent temperature measurements, each probe should be inserted the same distance into the contrast-containing spheres.
>In our case, the set distance is marked off with a small piece of tape. The probe is sufficiently inserted when the tape is touching the surface of the phantom.

##Opening and Installing FOT Probes
>The optical cables themselves are kept in a white, Patient's Belongings bag (permanent home TBD). This bag also contains the cables that connect the probes to the data logger as well as the Serial to USB cable used to interface with the computer.

>The main input hub is in a black Pelican case (permanent home TBD), which also contains the power cord for the device.
*<Add an image of case here>*
###Setup Procedure
* Remove the hub and power cables from the case and connect them accordingly

* The power cord may be plugged into the hub at this time, but ensure the power swtich on the cord is in the "off" (o) position.

* The cable that connects the optical probes and the hub can now be connected

*<picture>*
* This cable can only be connected in one orientation and is secured by a spring mechanism
*<more pictures if needed>*
* When inserting the connecting cables, it is important to match the number of the cable (written on green tape) to the number of the input on the hub.
*<picture>*
* The optical probes can now be removed from their cases and connected, taking great care not t crush or bend the probes
* The probes are not numerically labeled and can be attached to any numbered cable.
* The connection mechanism between the fiber optic probe and the cable has a flat surface on both components that must be aligned during connection in order to produce a complete connection. If the probe and cable are not connected in this manner, there is a strong chance the temperature data will not be collected or will be wrong.
*<pictures>*
* The FOT can accomodate up to 4 inputs, however, fewer optical probes may be connected, depending on the needs of your study.
* After the probes are connected, connect the hub to your computer with the Serial to USB cable
