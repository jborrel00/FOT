#Fiber Optic Temperature Measurement
###Operation Instructions
#####For OS X 10.7+

>This tutorial will walk you through the steps required to use the LumaSense Technolofies Luxtron FTO Lab Kit, CoolTerm application, and a Mac computer to collect accurate and precise temperature data for various applications.
>This tutorial will deal with the software and hardware prerequisites, equipment unpacking and setup, operation of the CoolTerm software, and the logging of data to a text file that can be subsequently accessed through a number of software platforms.

##Prerequisites
>In order to read the Luxtron temperature data, you will have to install CoolTerm.
* To install CoolTerm, go to [http://freeware.the-meiers.org/] (http://freeware.the-meiers.org/) and locate the CoolTerm application.
* Click on the link for **Mac** under the CoolTerm logo and download the zip file
* Extract the files from the dowloaded zip file
* Once extracted, the CoolTerm application can be run from the directory it was downloaded to
* *Since Macs typically keep all applications in the Apllications folder, you may move either the entire extracted CoolTerm folder, or just the CoolTerm application to that folder on your computer. The application will run the same way.*

>The Luxtron FOT probes are very thin and very fragile. While they can be used in a variety of media, including water and aqueous solutions, great care must be taken to **ensure the cables are not bent excessively or placed in a substance that could be corosive or become adhered to the end of the optic probe.**
